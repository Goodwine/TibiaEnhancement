Tibia's Website Enhancement
===========================
If you play [Tibia](http://www.tibia.com), you'll probably think just like me that the website could have more
features. So this Chrome Extension is created to add to the website what I believe it is missing.

Background
----------
Loooong time ago, there was a guy (who was also a GM back in the days) known as Erig. He created some simple but
awesome scripts for GreaseMonkey (an addon for FireFox). For example, one addon showed you who were online when you
looked into a guild's page.  
Then some years ago TibiaML made a programming contest to make a tool useful for Tibia, and since developing a
Chrome Extension was way easier than making a FireFox addon,
[Tibia's Website Enhancement](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tibia-website-enhancement/jgbkpdolneinfmghjfeogblbggkojaab)
was created.  
However this extension is very old and has a lot of optimizations that could be done. So now I'm building it again from
the beginnning.

Features
--------
* Show **Who is Online** in a guild's page.
* Show the online status of a character on the forums.
* Show detailed information of a character when looking at it's page.
* Add links to fansites when looking at a world's page.
* Show *[permalink]* on the news.
* Add more BBCodes to the forum.
* Links to houses.
* MultiLanguage (this will be the last thing implemented)
* Set a default character to post, so you avoid having to keep selecting it.
* Star threads for easy follow up.

**Found a bug or want more features?**

It is included already in the code, but basically... You can't take my code to make money.
That means that you can take it, but whatever you do with it must be free.
