        <h2>Loading Strategy</h2>
        <p><small>
          The process that checks for online players loads every server to get their online status.
          This process can cause you lag in-game if you have a very slow internet connection, less
          than 1Mbps download, and if so, you may want to choose a slower loading strategy.

        <h2>Short story</h2>
        <section>
        <p>
          Loooong time ago, there was a guy (who was also a GM back in the days) known as Erig.
          He created some simple but awesome scripts for GreaseMonkey (an addon for FireFox).
          For example, one addon showed you who were online when you looked into a guild's page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then some years ago TibiaML made a programming contest to make a tool useful for Tibia,
          and since developing a Chrome Extension was way easier than making a FireFox addon,
          Tibia's Website Enhancement was created.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time Chrome was still not the most used browser, and Tibia had 90k users on a daily
          basis, hell... almost every server had 900 players, and there were login queues.</br>
          Now Chrome is the most used browser, but Tibia has lost a lot of players for several reasons,
          so yeah... I hope the current player base likes this extension. :)
